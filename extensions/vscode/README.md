# Solidity VSCode Extension

This is a Solidity demo showing the [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) integration for VS Code based on the Microsoft [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol).

TODO Describe me!

Required version for Visual Studio Code: 1.28.0
To install the VS Code extension for solidity run "gradlew startCode" via Command Line in the workspace.
